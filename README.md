The Smart Public Transportation System (TransitX) project aims to enhance the efficiency, comfort, and sustainability of urban travel by integrating multiple transportation modes, such as buses and trains, into a unified, user-friendly platform. The objective is to provide real-time updates on schedules, route availability, and crowd density, helping passengers make informed decisions and avoid congestion. The project's scope includes designing a responsive web-based application with secure user authentication, a route search interface, feedback collection, and notification systems. The system architecture leverages a MySQL database, Node.js for backend services, and Python-based machine learning for sentiment analysis of user feedback. A Random Forest model, trained on Twitter datasets, classifies feedback to identify areas of improvement. The platform is designed following proper database normalization and includes triggers for data validation. Key findings reveal that integrating crowd analytics and feedback sentiment significantly improves user experience and system adaptability. Despite limitations in real-time data sources and APIs, the system effectively demonstrates how modern tools and AI can address urban mobility challenges. The project contributes toward sustainable transportation by promoting public transit usage and providing an intelligent travel assistant for commuters.
